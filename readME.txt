IMPORTANT: Be careful if you rename the 'Audio' folder, as the paths in the main.py depend on it!

HOW TO USE GUIDE:
- To use this program, ensure that the song you want to make changes to is COPIED TO THE 'Audio' FOLDER
- Use WAV or MP3 files, this program can work with both
- Run main.py
- Follow the requests of the print statements that appear in the terminal
- Be patient, stretching an audio file can take several minutes based on how drastic of a change you requested
- Finally, when you receive a completion statement in the terminal, you can find a new mp3 file in the 'Audio' folder that is labelled with "slowed" or "sped-up"

You will notice that a wav file is created in the middle of the process of the program, this is done to allow for better audio manipulation.
This WAV file is deleted at the end of the program to clear up space, but don't fret as the mp3 file of your time-stretched song will be there!

Enjoy this program!
