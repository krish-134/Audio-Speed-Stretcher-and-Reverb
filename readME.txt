IMPORTANT: Be careful if you rename the 'Audio' folder, as the paths in the main.py depond on it!

HOW TO USE GUIDE:
- To use this program, ensure that the song you want to make changes to is COPIED TO THE 'Audio' FOLDER
- Use wav or mp3 files, this program can work with both
- Run main.py
- Follow the requests of the print statements that appear in terminal
- Be patient, stretching an audiofile can take several minutes based on how drastic of a change you requested
- Finally, when you recieve a completion statement in the termina, you can find a new mp3 file in the 'Audio' folder that is labeled with "slowed" or "sped-up"

You will notice that a wav file is created in the middle of the process of the program, this is done to allow for better audio manipulation.
This wav file is deleted at the end of the program to clear up space, but don't fret as the mp3 file of your time-stretched song will be there!

Enjoy this program!
